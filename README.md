### How it works:

1. When a Customer comes inside a restaurant, they can scan the restaurant QR code
present on their table from the FoodUs app.

2. After scanning they get to see the menu through which they can see each and every food item as an
Augmented reality visual on their table and they can finalise their order and pay directly from the app.

3. The seat number and order is then sent to the staff to process the food order.
